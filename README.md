# Node.js Assignment

The assignment is pretty simple, it was to create a simple module which contains our own biodata, such as name, date of birth, place of birth, and our address.

## Solution

I came up with the idea of OOP, so I created a class that contains attributes and methods to access each of them. This is the content of `utils.js`, where I define the class. Afterwards, all I need to do is import the class and create a new instance that contains my biodata within `index.js`.
