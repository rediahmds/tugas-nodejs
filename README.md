# Node.js Assignment

The assignment is pretty simple, it was to create a simple module which contains our own biodata, such as name, date of birth, place of birth, and our address.

## Solution

I came up with the idea of OOP. So, my idea was to create a class that contains these attributes and methods to access each of them. That is the content of `utils.js`, define a class. After that, I just need to import the class and create a new instance containing my biodata inside `index.js`.
